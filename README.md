BlackFramework
==============

Just another MVC framework. 

The idea behind this is to have a lightweight basecode with some of the most important functionality required for basic websites.

This is a Composer-Package containing the core scripts. For a working example application, please refer to:
[Basic application](https://github.com/fixwa/BlackFrameworkBasicApplication)

----------

##Install

For a fresh install, you would create a blank composer project:
    
    composer init

follow the instructions and once completed:

    composer require fixwa/black-framework --save

Now you should have the Black Framework available in your project, but you need to create your models/controllers/views by your own.
